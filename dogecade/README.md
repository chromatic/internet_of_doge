# Dogecade

Manage Dogecoin payments for arcade games and other coin-operated vending systems.

## Vision

Anyone who maintains a coin- or payment-operated system such as an arcade
machine, pinball machine, jukebox, vending machine should be able to convert
their systems to use a Dogecoin-based payment system with minimal overhead, low
costs, and reasonable security precaution.

## How will we know we've achieved our goal?

A system owner will be able to install and configure and use this system
(perhaps with help of an experienced technical user) to:

- receive payments in Dogecoin
- perform basic accounting
- integrate with existing Dogecoin wallets
- customize their machines, hardware, and other integration
- support user accounts and basic account management
- allow users to see their redemption history
- configure the security of the system for both administrators and users

## In Scope

The finished system will have these properties:

- open source code, to allow verification, validation, and customization
- an administrative interface
- (maybe) support other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin
- a responsive web interface to allow desktop and mobile use for both
  administrators and customers

We are not pursuing several lines of development, including:

- integration with specific accounting systems
- comprehensive hardware support
- native mobile app support
- comprehensive OIDC integration with multiple identity providers
- developing a new wallet, SPV or otherwise
